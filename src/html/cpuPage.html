                        Processor - What is this?

                        The processor is the brain of the computer. Is called a brain for a reason because it ensures the continuous operation of the entire computer.  Similar to the human brain. Every single operation that you do with your computer is processed in the CPU. The performance of your computer is based on simple mathematical operations, and the CPU is the device that controls all of those operations. while it is functioning, other components of the system unit and external devices connected to it will work.

                        With its help, the program code is processed, the operating system and installed applications work. The faster the processor speed, the faster the computer runs.

                    <div class="cpu__second-text_descr">
                        A multi-core processor is actually a CPU that has two or more independent cores. Cores are similar to usual processors; they execute program instructions. The main advantage of a multi-core processor is that it can run several instructions at the same time. This feature increases performance speed significantly. All programs that have parallel computing features can run on multi-core processors.
