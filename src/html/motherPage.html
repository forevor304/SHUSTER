            <p>In computing, the motherboard is the main integrated circuit card, that has all the slots and connections to which the rest of the parts of a computer are connected so that the computer system works properly.
                RAM, processor, video card, and data storage devices are, they themselves are a bunch of computer hardware. To turn it into a working machine, you need a platform that unites all the components into a working system unit. This function is performed by the motherboard.
            </p>

            <p>In addition to internal slots, for connecting the main components, connectors for connecting external devices and peripherals are also soldered on the PCB. Therefore, the motherboard also integrates all devices into a fully functional computer.</p>

            <p>The motherboard can be said to be the basis of a personal computer since the essential components such as CPU, graphic card, RAM, hard drives, expansion slots, CMOS, Mouse, Keyboard, and the power supply are directly connected to it. You can say the motherboard is the foundation of the computer itself.</p>

            <p> The BIOS firmware is the permanent software installed on the motherboard, that allows regulating and testing the elementary functions of the hardware and acts as a support for loading the various operating systems like Windows, Mac, Linux, and others. </p>

            <h4>Sizes and Form - Factors</h4>

            <p>The size of motherboards is called “Form Factor”, and you should not be fooled by their dimensions, taking them as a reference of their capacity, since their size is independent of their power.</p>
