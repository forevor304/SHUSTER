        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Michael and I am 20 years old, I created this site as part <br> of a final project at Amit Technological College.
            I really like learning new things and evolving in them, and creating a website was the most serious challenge I faced.
            During the development i encounter a lot of difficulties, especially in searching for information and troubleshooting.
            I built a website to address beginners in computer hardware, I wanted to give tool information about each of the computer components in an accessible and simple way, without going into too much detail.
            Hope you like the site I developed.</p>
